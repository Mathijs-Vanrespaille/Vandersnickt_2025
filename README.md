Abstract: Internal magnetic fields are an elusive component of stellar structure. However, they can play an important role in stellar structure and evolution models through efficient angular momentum transport and their impact on internal mixing.
We strive to explain the 9 components in the frequency multiplet of an identified low-order quadrupole gravity mode detected in the light curve of the beta Cep pulsator HD 192575 assembled by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).
We update the frequency values of the quadrupole mode under investigation from a standard prewhitening method applied to the 1951.46 d TESS light curve. We develop novel theoretical pulsation computations including the Coriolis force as well as a magnetic field that is misaligned with respect to the rotation axis. We apply our theoretical description to the multiplet of the quadrupole g~mode and 
perform asteroseismic modelling of this evolved beta Cep star.
Pulsation predictions based on the measured internal rotation frequency of the star cannot explain the observed 9-component frequency splittings of the quadrupole low-order gravity mode. By contrast, we show that the combined effect of the Coriolis force caused by the near-core rotation with a period of ?? d and the Lorentz force  due to an internal inclined magnetic field with a maximum strength of ~160 kG does provide a proper explanation of the 9 multiplet frequencies and their relative amplitudes.
Given HD 192575's  stellar mass of about 12 Msun, this work presents the first firm detection and magneto-gravito-asteroseismic modelling of a stable internal magnetic field buried deep inside an evolved rotating supernova progenitor.
